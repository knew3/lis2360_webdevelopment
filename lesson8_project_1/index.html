        <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
            <p>Amazing feminist movements have been created and influenced by social media networks like Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube. How impactful has social media been on feminism?
            </p>   
             <p>Feminism is strongly known for beginning in the early eighteen hundreds resulting later with the 19th amendment introducing the womens' right to vote, <br>
                and then with second wave feminism in the sixties
                and seventies with the more aggressive feminism. Today a new feminism has emerged and has become more widespread, especially with the power of social media. This new wave of feminism has
                used social media to it's full potential, bringing issues to light, giving platforms for discussions. The more level playing field that social media creates gives women a fair platform
                compared to other media outletes. This new frontier has created feminist discussions bringing people from all walks of life together for a common goal.
             </p>
            <p>
                Social Media has encouraged people to speak out about what is wrong and what we can do together to fix it. The modern-day feminism has used social media  to the fullest, using it to
                organize and bring women together and representing women different than the traditional media. With the power of social media it can be used to bridge the gap that women are born with .
                The awareness raised through social media has started the conversation that needed to be have.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Now online there are more feminist resources for people to use through social media. There are plenty of podcasts, websites, accounts, etc. that help convey the feminist message of equality.
                Social media can be used to help change the social perception that is associated with the classic stereotype of being a feminist. Because of the casual media forms feminism can now be in, it
                is less formal and can be less intimidating for people that want to use their voice. It is now easy for people to provide information for people that wantto learn more about feminism.
             </p>
    
             <p>
                Some famous movements that have been created by hashtags are "#WhyIStayed,", "#NotBuyingIt", "#YesAllWomen".These have gone viral on Twitter, very influential in changing peoples views.The
                way it has mobilized the public has been incredible. The topics discussed have ranged from sexual abuse to domestic abuse, and rape, these are only a few. Women have a chance to change the
                narrative and the story that has been given to them, but this way their voices can grow and be heard.
